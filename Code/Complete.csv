So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they know

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Metallica,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Metallica,"[Verse 1]
New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

[Verse 2]
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been

Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for their right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four hundred years

Go, I will be with thee

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""rage""?

Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies

Bound by the world all alone

Alright

[Verse 1]
We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you, to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving

And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

Metallica,"[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 2]
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 3]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Outro]
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah
There I go, yeah, here I go
There I go, there I go

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

[Verse 2]
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

[Refrain]
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

[Pre-Chorus]
So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You’re falling, but you think you’re flying high
High again
[Chorus]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you’re thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, boy, I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Damn, damn)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you

""Excuse me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?

You're like: ""I love you—who starts a conversation like that?"" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to

I will never dare to tell

I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""

You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)

Ariana-grande,"[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A

[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under

Know what I'm doing

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go

All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)

Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you

And it feels so much lighter

I think of you
I haven't slept

I don't forget
My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try
My heart stays still

It never moves
Just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my

Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out

The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself and love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees

With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy

Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type

Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

[Verse 3]
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, ""A tight dress is what makes you a whore""

Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before

Losing feeling is getting old

The way I'm drinkin' you down

Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose

Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

You are my strange addiction

My doctors can't explain

I used to think you were shy (Shy)
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (Mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(So) So easy (So, so)
Hee, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours

You ain't nothing but a lost cause (Cause)
And this ain't nothing like it once was (Was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (Yeah)

I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

[Verse 2]
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged

[Verse 2]
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged

[Chorus]
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't
[Verse 3]
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm

Just keep me employed now, mmm

But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be

Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends

Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again

Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood

Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

The kinda girl you like is right here with me (Hello!)

[Bridge]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe ?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

[Chorus]
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me (Hello!)

I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl

Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl

Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately

Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

Hey! I'ma keep running

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice

Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?

So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now... hold up!
[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97 I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Beyonce,"Part 1: Ghost
[Intro: Young Beyoncé & (Presenter)]
(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Soul not for sale

Perfection is so, mmm

I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you

You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible

He told me when he's gone, ""Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
""Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no""

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous
[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
""Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no""

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)

Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'll be the help whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are

Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (He-he-he....)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

From when your hands are in mine

And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours

And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you

Beyonce,"[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing (Mean a thing), no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Hard time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment
[Bridge]
(You lied) I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', ""What's up with B?""
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied)
(You lied) And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)41EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You got to trust me, Ma

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women

Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got? Mmm
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

[Verse 1: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]
Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around, oh-oh
What a waste, another day
Another good one dyin'
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Why can’t we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can’t we just get along? Mmm
[Verse 2: James Taylor, Charlie Puth, Both]
What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves (Mmm)
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
(Why can’t we just get along?) Why can’t we just get along?
(Why can’t we just get along?) If loving one another's wrong
(Why can’t we just get along?) Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
I know we could break apart
We don't have to go that way
Not today, ooh

[Chorus: Charlie Puth, James Taylor, Both]
Yeah, why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to, yeah (Oh, oh)
(Why can't we just get along?) Why can't we just get along?
(Why can't we just get along?) If loving one another's wrong

Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free

[Chorus]
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free (Free), free (Free)

[Verse 2]
They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you wеre built too strong for that
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't tame a wild heart

[Chorus]
Free as thе grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free (Free)

[Bridge]
Oh, no one's ever putting out that fire inside
Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back, running fast and free

[Chorus]
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free, yeah (Free), free, yeah (Free)

Smile when you're talking to me
I don't wanna know your real pain
Long nights, I don't know your real name
Soft kiss when the yellow cab came
Til the next time when the sun fall
And my thoughts roam and the love calls
For your soft tone and your sweet talk
And your dial tone when you're not bothered
Hoping feelings never get brought up
Conversation never get broad
Still blind by the street lights
Never gonna let another man cross
Yes, I understand
Baby, loosen up your pants
Staring at me from your knees
Birds and the fucking bees

When you called like you always do when you want someone

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight248EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill87EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Maybe I waited too long

Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made
[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you60EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

[Verse 2]
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""273EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh)  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe410EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side262EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers

Me in the middle with the one I love and

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?

Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time

Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border26EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

[Chorus]
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
[Verse 2]
I sing, ""I write my own tune and I write my own verse,"" hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
[Verse 3]
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

[Pre-Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
[Chorus]
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

[Bridge]
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

[Verse 4]
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

[Bridge]
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

[Instrumental break]

[Interlude]
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea

[Verse 5]
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day

[Verse 6]
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

[Verse 7]
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

[Chorus]
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend ya
And I keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Bridge]
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day, discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Check it
I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that is dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Verse 3]
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Intro]
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
[Verse 3]
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

[Chorus]
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here

Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go

[Chorus]
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

[Verse 2]
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

[Chorus]
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end

Going through the motions, going through us

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

Ed-sheeran,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)

Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now
[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

[Bridge]
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend

I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
[Verse 2]
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover

Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me ""son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love
[Verse 2]
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me ""son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
[Verse 2]
Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another ""like you""
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?

[Chorus]
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
[Verse 3]
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (wo-oahh)
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied45EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
[Verse 2]
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now

[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Hook]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No

[Verse 4]
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

[Chorus]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
[Verse 2]
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again

[Chorus]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
[Bridge]
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

[Chorus (Extended)]
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
(Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
(Love will come and Love will go)
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
(But you can make it on your own)
Oh, won't you leave me now?
(Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
And I've been living on the road, Nina
(People grow and fall apart)
But then again you should know, Nina
(But you can mend your broken heart)
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ed-sheeran,"[Verse 1]
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?

[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to
[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

[Outro]
And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars

Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

Dua-lipa,"[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love

Your time is up, I'll tell you why

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like

I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home

Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone

If I ever slip, I'll fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it
Get out and get your bread up (Yeah, yeah)
They always leave when you fall, but you run together (Hey)
Weight of the world on my shoulders, I kept my head up

Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else

Fighting for you

And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby

And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her ""What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?""
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time

Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing

Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?

What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls abandon shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare

You've got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back

Just to see what if

Oh, the bird that’s flown into my room

The darkness is beneath

Dream-theater,"[I. Someone Like Him]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Instrumental Intro]
I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him!
So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time
As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him
[II. Medicate (Awakening)]
[Lyrics: James LaBrie]

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years, where have I been?
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening

I feel the relapse, can't break free
Eyes open, but not getting through to me
Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear, as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again
(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound

(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle

[IV. Intervals]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

Root, our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Second, asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Third, try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Fourth, loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Fifth, tortured Insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail
Sixth, the calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Seventh, innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Octave, step after step, we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
[V. Razor's Edge]

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge
A perfect sphere colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began!

Where did we come from
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before
Is anything certain in life?

They say ""Life is too short""
""The here and the now""
And ""You`re only given one shot.""
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend!
I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try!

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

""Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memory of me disappear!""

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has helped me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means!

Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man

Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time
He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
They'll buy into the words that I wrote:

""This feeling inside me!
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two!
I'd take my own life before losing you!""

I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He's always had my heart
He needs to know

Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two!

Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear

An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

Finally found my life, I'm finally free
No longer torn in two!

[II. Innocence]

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow
Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more
But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might
In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same
Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...
[III. Carpe Diem]
""Carpe diem
Seize the day...""
I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall, the sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away!
""Seize the Day!,"" I heard him say
""Life will not always be this way
Look around, hear the sounds
Cherish your life while you're still around""
(""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying"")
We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there may not be one
The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned
Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, ""I Love You... Good-bye!""
(""It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear;)
(Your mom... who you dearly love...)
(Has had to leave... all our lives"")
(""Seize the day!"")

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true
Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up
I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why
Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see!
I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay
And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I!
Hold on Boy, no time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away!

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me!

A lifetime of memories run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead

Life goes on the offbeaten track
I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
""Seize the day and don't you cry
Now it's time to say good-bye
Even though I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on!""10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow

[Bridge]
Death is the first dance, eternal

[Part 2]
There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined
To this mind

[Part 3]
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

[Part 4]
As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man, I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep, yet I'm so afraid

Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares the faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

Before we lock the doors

Confined and overtired

Home! it’s what I long for
Back home where I belong!

The city, it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow, eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help! I’m falling, I’m crawling
I can’t keep away from its clutch
Can’t have it, this habit

She poured her soul out all night and cried
I remember I was told there’s a new love that’s born
For each one that has died
I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can’t resist myself
No matter how hard I try!

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I’ll make her my wife!
Her sweet temptation calls me home

Home! It’s what I long for
My home, where she belongs!

Her ecstasy means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood

Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back!
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind!

[Verse 1]
Let me help you, how much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

[Chorus]
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

[Verse 2]
You feel I'm asking too much of you but can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy, empty and hollow
You lost your faith, there's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery, can't figure it out

[Interlude]
Sleepless, worse for wear, staring at the ceiling
Numb, sedated, intoxicated
[Pre-Chorus]
Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now

Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you

Maculate, there is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never ending tide

Don't try to read between the

Still running uphill, swimming against the current
I wish I weren't so fucked
Feels like I'm stuck
Lost in a sea of mediocrity
''Slow down! You're thinking too much. Where is your soul?''
You cannot touch the way I play
Or tell me what to say
You're in the way of all that I believe in

Dream-theater,"[Verse 1]
Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany
A young, eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way, I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by
My brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads
At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian

Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

[Chorus]
I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived
[Verse 2]
Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candlelight

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

[Pre-Chorus]
Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the English heir
The end is near
Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

[Chorus]
I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

[Outro]
""Now wait a minute, man!
That's not how it is!
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems

Please try to forgive!

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me...

The Count of Tuscany!""7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dream-theater,"Headline: ""Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echo's hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide""

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he'd turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said ""I can't love a wayward man""
She may have found a reason to forgive (oh yeah, yeah)
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer's pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

""I feel there's only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you""

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

Is carried beyond this life
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)

[II. About to Crash]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Verse]
She can't stop pacing
She never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing
Set on overdrive

It takes a village
This she knows is true
They're expecting her
And she's got work to do
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says ""I've never seen her get this bad""

Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by
She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade

Then one day
She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind

Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away

She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression

Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace

Boundless power
Midnight hour
She enjoyed the race

Napalm showers
Showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around
Through heat exhaustion
And mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground

[Chorus 1]
Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head
[Verse 2]
Years and years of
Bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill
A free vacation
Of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my...

[IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Verse]
Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night

Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
""The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution
He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself!""

Curled up in the darkness
Searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit
Streaming through the night

Random urine testing
Pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue

Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

""We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste
Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help?
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself!""

[V. Goodnight Kiss]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Verse]
Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head

Are you lonely without mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[VI. Solitary Shell]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Verse]
He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy

He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell

As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell?

He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time

As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine

He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell?

[VII. About to Crash (reprise)]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Verse]
I'm alive again
The darkness far behind me
I'm invincible
Despair will never find me

I feel strong
I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy
Euphoria fixation

Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad?

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by?

Will you be standing by?

[VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Verse]
She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway

She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time

Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives

Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls

Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart

Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in

A journey to find
The answers inside
Our elusive mind4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Where the grass is overgrown

To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I've been given so much more in life

To grieve for her and say goodbye

Concentrate on your breathing

Imagine a brilliant white light above you

Allow yourself to drift off as you fall
Deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind

She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest night

[Verse 2]
Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories
All rush into his head
By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she dances
She was dancing through the night above his bed

[Chorus]
And walking to the window
He throws the shutters out against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears her call
""Let light surround you""
[Bridge]
It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light

[Verse 3]
Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the pain
But mine will never be the same

[Chorus]
He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from the wall
And from an ivory tower hears her call
""Let the light surround you""

[Verse 4]
Once lost but I was found
When I heard the stained glass shatter all around me
I sent the spirits tumbling down the hill
But I will hold this one on high above me still
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last I'm blind
[Outro]
I know it's easier to walk away
Than look it in the eye
But I had given all that I could take
And now I've only habits left to break
Tonight I'll still be lying here
Surrounded in all the lightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dream-theater,"VIII: Regret
[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Hello Mirror!
So glad to see you, my friend
It's been a while

[Verse 1]
Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late
[Verse 2]
Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

IX: Restitution
[Excerpts of fellow musicians' apologies]
""Until that moment
I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything
I felt like I failed her
And I failed myself, and I failed my children
It's still really hard to deal with.""
""I want to thank you for helping me
To see my own selfishness
And to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you.""

""I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa
When you were on your deathbed
I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral...
I don't know if I was selfish or I just was too scared to face it
It's one of the biggest regrets of my life.""

""I'm here to confess with you that what I did was wrong
And I'm asking for your forgiveness...""

""The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed
Looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather.""

""I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy.""

""One of my best friends, who's the godfather of my daughter
He asked me to sing or play something at his wedding
And I turned it down because I was busy and
I guess, too much of a chickenshit to do it
And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very, very close friend of mine.""

""So, I wanted to apologize to anyone
That I've upset or offended by my words
It's just an opinion, but unfortunately
I tend to express it as a fact
And that's kind of arrogant. Isn't it?""
""I think it's the betrayal
It still haunts me.""
""I'm sorry for what I did back then
I was a different person
I really was and I'm so sorry
I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did
And I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?""

""I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you
I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way.""

[Spoken Outro: Mike Portnoy]
“If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it

We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone
We will see how our experience can benefit others
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear

We will lose interest in selfish things
And gain interest in our fellows
Self-seeking will slip away
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change

Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us
What we could not do for ourselves

Are these extravagant promises? We think not
They have been fulfilled amongst others:
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly
We will always be true to our principles.”

""You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.""

""The truth is the truth
And so all you can do is live with it.""1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Dream-theater,"[VI. Ready]
Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief
Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be

[VII. Remove]

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out of this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul
I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go
I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day

I am ready
Help me be what I can be

I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

Not enough positive reaction

Time to transcend, block out the noise

Dream-theater,"[Verse 1]
We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter
You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see
You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
''Gimme time to re-charge my batteries
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee''
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality!
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

[Pre-Chorus 1]
On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow

[Chorus 1]
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I tried your 4 bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again

Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street?
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show

[Chorus 2]
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

[Verse]
Cunning, baffling, powerful
(Been beaten to a pulp)
Vigorous, irresistible
(Sick and tired and laid low)
Dominating, invincible
(Black-out, loss of control)
Overwhelming, unquenchable
(I'm powerless, have to let go)

I can't escape it
It leaves me frail and worn
Can no longer take it
Senses tattered and torn

Hopeless surrender
Obsession's got me beat
Losing the will to live
Admitting complete defeat

Fatal descent
Spinning around
I've gone too far
To turn back round
Desperate attempt
Stop the progression
At any length
Lift this obsession

Crawling to my glass prison, a place where no one knows
My secret lonely world begins
So much safer here, a place where I can go
To forget about my daily sins

Life here in my glass prison, a place I once called home
Fall in nocturnal bliss again
Chasing a long lost friend I no longer can control
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end
[II. Restoration]
[Verse 1]
Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
A shattered glass prison wall behind me
Fight - past walking through the ashes
A distant oasis before me
Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
Begging god to please stop the insanity
Help me - I'm trying to believe
Stop wallowing in my self pity
""We've been waiting for you my friend
The writing's been on the wall
All it takes is a little faith
You know you're the same as us all""

[Chorus]
Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

[Verse 2]
Enter the door
Desperate
Fighting no more
Help me restore
To my sanity
At this temple of hope

I need to learn
Teach me how
Sorrow to burn
Help me return
To humanity
I'll be fearless and thorough
To enter this temple of hope
Believe
Transcend the pain
Living the life
Humility
Opened my eyes
This new odyssey
Of rigorous honesty

Serenity
I never knew
Soundness of mind
Helped me to find
Courage to change
All the things that I can

""We'll help you perform this miracle
But you must set your past free
You dug the hole, but you can't bury your soul
Open your mind and you'll see""

[Verse]
Way off in the distance I saw a door
I tried to open
I tried forcing with all of my will but still
The door wouldn't open

Unable to trust in my faith
I turned and walked away
I looked around, felt a chill in the air
Took my will and turned it over

The glass prison which once held me is gone
A long lost fortress
Armed only with liberty
And the key of my willingness

Fell down on my knees and prayed
""Thy will be done""
I turned around, saw a light shining through
The door was wide open!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had

Idol and best friend

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together

The morning shows on the radio
The case of the missing dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude
The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
And when we weren't together
The hours on the phone

I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever

Our lives changed forever more

But prepare for the end...""

Flying through each day

But time just slipped away
Remember: ""Seize the Day""!

Thank you for the smiles

Wrapped in silence
No more screaming

""Tell me does this hurt you?""
Said the faceless man
""Can you move all of your fingers?
Can you try your best to stand?""

Searching, fearless, where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?

Face yourself, man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living like a one-way cold existence all the while!
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes, you long lost child!

Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold

Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you
Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain into blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty-one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

[Verse 2]
Possessive obsessions, selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments, passing all the blame

[Fast Rap Verse 2]
Living out a life of decadence
Acting without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while they can't stand the thought of you!
[Verse 3]
A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

[Chorus 1]
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

[Bridge]
Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

[V. Release]
[Verse]
Come to me my friend (listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)
You'll find your peace of mind (give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (break out of this isolation)
Let humility (openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (a healing tranquility)

Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help i know you can
Be at one with god and man

Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break through this prison wall


Dedicated to Bill W. And all of his friends3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dream-theater,"[Verse 1]
There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
I swear she cast a spell on me
Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away
Try to find the words
None sit right with me
Air of confidence
But I can barely breathe

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's without a care
Electrified and held there
A thousand volts igniting me
Her waves crash over me
Far below, out of reach
The undertow, my reverie

[Bridge]
Sadness in her smile
Love, it's been a while
Near but far away
She chases it each day
A promise to come back
All the while still waiting
Seems it lost its way
[Chorus]
Out of reach
Just too hard to reach
You're letting your life slip away
Out of reach
Yeah, it's hard to reach
There's another day
Although you're hurting and afraid
You're stronger than yesterday

And as I'm standing here right now
I'm finally shown what I have always known
Coincidence I can't believe
As my childhood dreams slowly come true

Are these her memories
Awakened through my eyes?
This house has brought back to life!

An open door

The walls disappear
To some woman who's screaming
A man pleads forgiveness

Dream-theater,"[Verse 1]
Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness
Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return again

[Hook]
Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole

[Chorus]
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie!
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice!
[Verse 2]
Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles burn

[Hook]
Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole

[Chorus]
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie!
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice!
[Chorus 2]
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!

[Instrumental section]

[Bridge]
Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart
Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance

All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream
Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice
[Chorus 2]
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!

Dream-theater,"[Intro]
Tell me, remind me
Chase the water racing from the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
Liquid shadows silence their screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes

[Chorus]
Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

[Verse]
Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her survival
By your hand
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name

Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

Stevie-wonder,"[Verse 1]
As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always
[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Always)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

[Verse 2]
Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha

Without you who conceived the one

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you

Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

Why did those days ever have to go?

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

Gimme your hands up you punk!
I'm just going across the street

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can
[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Bridge 2]
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

[Outro]
We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday

Stevie-wonder,"[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun
[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'

Stevie-wonder,"[Verse 1]
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

[Verse 2]
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I

Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky

If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers

Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask, ""Will you be coming back soon?""
You don't know, never know

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed
[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide

Stevie-wonder,"[Verse 1]
Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time that you are near to me baby?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true
And that is why

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, ""Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more""

Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, no no no
I never can say goodbye...9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Stevie-wonder,"[Verse 1]
First man to die
For the flag we now hold high
Was a Black man
The ground where we stand
With a flag held in our hand
Was first the red man's
Guide of a ship
On the first Columbus trip
Was a brown man
The railroads for trains
Came on tracking that was laid
By the yellow man

[Chorus]
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red, blue, and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again
It's time we learned
This world was made for all men
(Check it)
[Verse 2]
Heart surgery
Was first done successfully
By a Black man
Friendly man who died
But helped the Pilgrims to survive
Was a red man
Farm workers' rights
Were lifted to new heights
By a brown man
Incandescent light
Was invented to give sight
By the white man

[Chorus]
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red, blue, and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again

This world was made for all men
Hear me out
Oh

Now I know the birthday of a nation
Is a time when a country celebrates
But as your hand touches your heart
Remember we all played a part
In America to help that banner wave

[Verse 3]
First clock to be made
In America was created
By a Black man
Scout who used no chart
Helped lead Lewis and Clark
Was a red woman
Use of martial arts
In our country got its start
By a yellow man
And the leader with a pen
Signed his name to free all men
Was a white man

[Chorus]
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red, blue, and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again
It's time we learned
This world was made for all men
World was made for all men
This world was made for all men
World was made for all men
[Verse 4]
God saved His world for all men
All peoples
All babies
All children
All colors
All races
This world's for you
And me
This world
My world
Your world
Everybody's world
This world
Their world
Our world
This world was made for all men

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go

With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go

And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes

Weak ones standing tall

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give, he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they won't go when I go

Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see

Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then

My mama boo-hooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her""
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree

That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer

Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind?

But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?

Is could a place like this exist so beautiful

That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

[Chorus]
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl, That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand

For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard

She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says ""It's a crazy scene""

I can't ever touch the sky

Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time

The road you leave behind

To write the words again

In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose

The losing side I'll play

Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October

Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer, he begins
Forcing danger's way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when, he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours

We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""you haven't done nothin'""

It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me

Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start

I've always come to the conclusion that ""but"" is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on one's head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside, I think you should know

And baby, that's you, you, you
Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

[Verse 2]
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the street
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell

One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold

Still away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold

When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun

Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined

But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well

Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
Oh, I need you, baby; I need you, baby

Packing my bags, going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

[Verse 1]
There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages, all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me, why are you people so cold?

I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high
[Verse 2]
We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women, and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

Like those who curse their luck in too many places

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

Conditioned to respond to all the threats

Though I hate to make a choice
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
Well we'll see

I don't think she'd bluff this time
I really have to make her mine
It's plain to see
It's him or me

[Chorus]
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
[Verse 2]
The fact he's over six feet ten
Might instill fear in other men
But not in me
The mighty flea
Ask if I am mouse or man
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
He'll murder me
In time for his tea
Does it bother me at all
My rival is Neanderthal
It makes me think
Perhaps I need a drink
IQ is no problem here
We won't be playing Scrabble for
Her hand I fear
I need that beer

[Chorus]
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
[Bridge]
Seven days will quickly go
The fact remains, I love her so
Seven days, so many ways
But I can't run away
I can't run away

[Chorus]
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
(Sunday'd be too late)
Sunday'd be too late

Do I have to tell a story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"[Verse 1]
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day
[Verse 2]
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus 2]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river’s wide, we’ll swim across
Started up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
Started up a brand new day

[Bridge 1]
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm a bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I’m the plow and you’re the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah
[Bridge 2]
I’m the present to your future
You’re the wound and I’m the suture
You’re the magnet to my pole
I’m the devil in your soul
You’re the pupil, I’m the teacher
You’re the church and I’m the preacher
You’re the flower, I’m the rain
You’re the tunnel, I’m the train

[Outro]
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day

[Bridge 3]
You’re the crop to my rotation
You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down
You’re the stair and I’m the handle
You’re the flame and I’m the candle
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you
And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"[Verse 1]
A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face

[Chorus]
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head

[Verse 2]
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
[Chorus]
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid
'Til you love me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

White page, an empty field of snow
My room is 25 below
This cold man chasing ghosts
A road lies underneath the buried posts
Dogs search the under forest
We scour the empty streets
The fact remains until we find you
Our lives are incomplete

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I hear laughter through a veil of snow and ice?
Where could you be on such a lonely winter's night?

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you
That's why I'm searching night and day
This heart's a lonely hunter
These hands are frozen fists
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't care if you exist

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do I hear laughter from behind this veil of midnight?
What are you hiding in the frozen heart of winter?
Somewhere a church bell tolls
I know you're close, the scent's still warm
Then the trail turns cold, cold, cold
[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop wanting you this way
I can't face living without you

Sting,"[Verse 1]
I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
[Verse 2]
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

[Verse 3]
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

[Bridge]
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

[Outro]
All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one

Like I love you
I would walk away in shame

Like he owns a bird that sings

The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion

Give you all I've got to give

And shout my name at heaven's gate

And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying
I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

It's all there in the gospels, the Magdalene girl
Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still
""Tell me where are you going Lord, and why in such haste?""
Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I can not be missing, the lads will expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

And the last ship sails

[Verse 2]
Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea

And the last ship sails

[Verse 3]
It's a strange kind of beauty
It's cold and austere
And whatever it was that you've done to be here
It's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears

And the last ship sails

[Verse 4]
Well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least

[Chorus]
And the last ship sails

Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done
And whatever the station in life you've become
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire
[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire

That wakes me from my slumber?

Beneath the pale lamplight

The bright lights, the people
And the moon and all

That I became what I am

Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon

The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest

Oh you'll never see my shade

The streets of New Orleans

And destroy the thing I love

With a smile upon my face

Have some coffee while I muse
Where could this smile have come from?
It's a muscle that I rarely use

Can you explain what's ailing me?

In the quiet time of evening
When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
And we wondered just what happened
To the life we knew before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me and you reminded me
That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter
But you stayed in my corner
The only world I know was upside down
And now the world and me, I know you carry me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But we made it through in the dark night
Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me

[Verse 2]
I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different, you showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure
But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game
And you could've made it through
But your funny friend and me
[Chorus]
You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet and that bigger guy
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together till the end is nigh
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together till the day we die
If I had to do this all a second time
I won't complain or make a fuss
Who would the angels send but that unlikely blend
Of those two funny friends
That's usEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"[Verse 1]
Why are there women here dancing on their own?
Why is there this sadness in their eyes?
Why are the soldiers here, their faces fixed like stone?
I can't see what it is that they despise

[Chorus]
They're dancing with the missing
They're dancing with the dead
They dance with the invisible ones
Their anguish is unsaid
They're dancing with their fathers
They're dancing with their sons
They're dancing with their husbands
They dance alone... they dance alone

[Verse 2]
It's the only form of protest they're allowed
I've seen their silent faces scream so loud
If they were to speak these words, they'd go missing too
Another woman on a torture table... what else can they do?

[Chorus]
They're dancing with the missing
They're dancing with the dead
They dance with the invisible ones
Their anguish is unsaid
They're dancing with their fathers
They're dancing with their sons
They're dancing with their husbands
They dance alone... they dance alone
[Post-Chorus]
One day we'll dance on their graves
One day we'll sing our freedom
One day we'll laugh in our joy
And we'll dance
One day we'll dance on their graves
One day we'll sing our freedom
One day we'll laugh in our joy
And we'll dance

[Spoken: Rubén Blades]
Ellas danzan con los desaparecidos
Danzan con los muertos
Danzan con amores invisibles
Con silenciosa angustia, danzan con sus padres
Con sus hijos, danzan con sus esposos
Ellas danzan solas, danzan solas

[Verse 3]
Hey Mr. Pinochet
You've sown a bitter crop
It's foreign money that supports you
One day the money's going to stop
No wages for your torturers
No budget for your guns
Can you think of your own mother
Dancing with her invisible son
[Chorus]
They're dancing with the missing
They're dancing with the dead
They dance with the invisible ones
Their anguish is unsaid
They're dancing with their fathers
They're dancing with their sons
They're dancing with their husbands
They dance alone... they dance alone

[Post-Chorus]
One day we'll dance on their graves
One day we'll sing our freedom
One day we'll laugh in our joy
And we'll dance
One day we'll dance on their graves
One day we'll sing our freedom
One day we'll laugh in our joy

Under the dog star sail
Over the reefs of moonshine
Under the skies of fall
North-northwest, the Stones of Faroe
Under the Arctic fire
Over the seas of silence
Hauling on frozen ropes
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?

All colours bleed to red
Asleep on the ocean's bed
Drifting on empty seas
For all my days remaining
But would north be true?

Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?

Dark angels follow me
Over a godless sea
Mountains of endless falling
For all my days remaining
What would be true?
Sometimes I see your face
The stars seem to lose their place
Why must I think of you?
Why must I?
Why should I?

Why should I cry for you?
Why would you want me to?
And what would it mean to say
""I loved you in my fashion""?
What would be true?
Why should I?
Why should I cry for you?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

If I caught the world in a bottle
And everything was still beneath the moon
Without your love would it shine for me?
If I was smart as Aristotle
And understood the rings around the moon
What would it all matter if you loved me?

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing would I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancing's end

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, Until...

One day you’ll meet a stranger
And all the noise is silenced in the room
You’ll feel that you're close to some mystery
In the moonlight and everything shatters
You feel as if you’ve known her all your life
The world’s oldest lesson in history

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil

Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear

Sting,"[Verse 1]
Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head
[Verse 4]
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

Sting,"If I should close my eyes, that my soul can see
And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there

It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there

Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home

And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there

One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control
And bury the waste in a great big hole

We work the black seam together
We work the black seam together

The seam lies underground
Three million years of pressure packed it down
We walk through ancient forest lands
And light a thousand cities with our hands

Have made redundant all our mining skills
You can't exchange a six inch band
For all the poisoned streams in Cumberland

It would be better to be cool
It's not time to be open just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
Or I'll be taken for a fool

The blood runs so red to my face

If somebody up there likes me somebody up there cares
Deliver me from evil save me from these wicked snares
Not into temptation, not to cliffs to fall
On to revelation, and lesson for us all

I knew whatever happened our friendship would end
Chemical reaction, desire at first sight
Mystical attraction, turned out all my lights

The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die
The minute I saw her face the second I caught her eye
The minute I touched the flame I knew it would never die

I don't know if it's pain or pleasure that I seek
My flesh was all too willing, my spirit guide was weak
I was deadly certain thoughts for me weren't kind

Blessed St. Theresa the whore of Babylon
Madonna and my mother all rolled into one
You've got to understand me, I'm not a piece of wood

Round, like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning
On an ever spinning reel

Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes on it's face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of it's own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes on it's face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly
Was it something that you said?

Lovers walking along the shore
Leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
And a fragment of this song
Half remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of her hair

Let me watch by the fire and remember my days
And it may be a trick of the firelight
But the flickering pages that trouble my sight
Is a book I'm afraid to write

It's the book of my days, it's the book of my life
And it's cut like a fruit on the blade of a knife
And it's all there to see as the section reveals
There's some sorrow in every life

If it reads like a puzzle, a wandering maze
Then I won't understand 'til the end of my days
I'm still forced to remember
Remember the words of my life

[Verse 2]
There are promises broken and promises kept
Angry words that were spoken, when I should have wept
There's a chapter of secrets, and words to confess
If I lose everything that I possess
There's a chapter on loss and a ghost who won't die
There's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry
There are sentences served in a prison I built out of lies

[Chorus]
Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read
In the book of my life
[Verse  3]
There's a chapter on fathers a chapter on sons
There are pages of conflicts that nobody won
And the battles you lost and your bitter defeat
There's a page where we fail to meet

There are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned
There's a chapter on god that I don't understand
There's a promise of Heaven and Hell but I'm damned if I see

Though the pages are numbered
I can't see where they lead
For the end is a mystery no-one can read

And if one sentence is true

Sting,"Old enough to be her dad
But the young men were just mad they nursed their grievances
And she was flattered by his charm
It wouldn't do her any harm they all had their chances

He sent her flowers and limousines
She was treated like a queen
Anything she ever wanted
It was no problem for a man like him
And everyone expected soon
That she could ask him for the moon
If she would wear his ring

Knowing glances from his friends
In the homes at the weekends of high society
But he didn't give a damn
He never felt more like a man

And all the time the clock was ticking
And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes, all would envy

In a house upon a hill
She was there with time to kill
She lived a life she'd only dreamed
The life was never what it seemed
To all her friends that she'd ignored
She denied she was bored
She had no time for dancing, no time for dancing
But the clock upon the wall
That was ticking in the hall
Always reminded her
That life was going on as well
But she was happy and she would swear she wouldn't change a thing

And all would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Yes, all would envy

Now it's 5 o'clock AM
She must have spent the night again with that old friend of hers
She loves to dance
She's missing more and more these days
But he's still stuck in his old ways
Perhaps she needs a little more romance
But the clock upon the wall is still ticking in the hall
She must be home soon, soon
Where a younger man would weep
He takes a pill and goes to sleep

Now who would envy the older man and his beautiful young wife
Who would envy?

I watch the western sky, the sun is sinking
The geese are flying south, it sets me thinking
I did not miss you much, I did not suffer
What did not kill me just made me tougher

I feel the winter come, his icy sinews
Now in the firelight, the case continues
Another night in court, the same old trial
The same old questions asked, the same denial

The shadows close me round, like jury members
I look for answers in the fire's embers
Why was I missing then, that whole December?
I give my usual line: I don't remember

Another winter comes, his icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine, these memories never sleep
And all these differences, a cloak I borrow
We kept our distances, why should it follow
That I must have loved you?

What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
I never could find a place to hide
What moves the Earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail
A mast without a sail
[Verse 2]
The moon's a fingernail and slowly sinking
Another day begins and now I'm thinking
That this indifference was my invention
When everything I did sought your attention
You were my compass star, you were my measure
You were a pirate's map of buried treasure
If this was all correct, the last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests, it's time that I confess:
I must have loved you

My dear old mother said to me
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
My dearest son, come home from sea
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

Oh, ye pinks and posies
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

It's 'round Cape Horn we all must go
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
'Round Cape Horn in the frost and snow

You've got your advance, and to sea you'll go
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
To chase them whales through the frost and snow
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
Oh, ye pinks and posies
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

It's 'round Cape Horn you've got to go
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
For that is where them whalefish blow
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

Oh, ye pinks and posies
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

It's growl you may, but go you must
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
If you growl too much your head they'll bust
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

Oh, ye pinks and posies
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

Just one more pull and that will do
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down
For we're the boys to kick her through
Go down, ye blood red roses, Go down

Sting,"[Verse 1]
Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am
She says the kids are fine, that they miss me
Maybe I could come and baby-sit sometime
She says, ""Are you O.K.? I was worried about you
Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."" I said

[Chorus]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 2]
I saw a friend of mine
He said, ""I was worried about you
I heard she had another man
I wondered how you felt about it?"" I said

[Chorus]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 3]
Saw my lawyer, Mr Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation
[Chorus 2]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

[Verse 4]
I took a walk alone last night
I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me
I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

[Verse 5]
The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother
Everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?

[Outro]
I saw that friend of mine, he said
""You look different somehow""
I said, ""Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime""
[Chorus 2]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"[Verse 1]
The boy child is locked in the fisherman's yard
There's a bloodless moon where the ocean died
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie
Where is the fisherman, where is the goat?
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat?
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies
Where is the child with his father's eyes?

There are the soul cages [x2]

He's the king of the ninth world
The twisted son of the fog bells toll
In each and every lobster cage
A tortured human soul

These are the souls of broken factories
The subject slaves of the broken crown
The dead accounting of old guilty promises
These are the souls of the broken town

[Chorus]
These are the soul cages[x4]

[Verse 2]
'I have a wager' the brave child spoke
The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke
'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me
And if the drink leaves me standing, a soul shall go free'
'I have here a cask of most magical wine
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line
It's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died
Young white bodies adrift in the tide'
'And what's in it for me, my pretty young thing?
Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings?
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea
You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me
A body lies open in the fisherman's yard
Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips
One less soul in the soul cages
One last curse on the fisherman's lips

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Swim to the light
Swim to the light

And he dreamed of the ship on the sea
It would carry his father and he
To a place they could never be found
To a place far away from this town
A Newcastle ship without coals
They would sail to the island of souls1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sting,"[Verse 1]
Mercury falling
I rise from my bed
Collect my thoughts together
I have to hold my head
It seems that she's gone
And somehow I am pinned by
The Hounds of Winter
Howling in the wind
I walk through the day
My coat around my ears
I look for my companion
I have to dry my tears
It seems that she's gone
Leaving me too soon
I'm as dark as December
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon

[Chorus]
I still see her face
As beautiful as day
It's easy to remember
Remember my love that way
All I hear is that lonesome sound
The Hounds of Winter
They follow me down
[Verse 2]
I can't make up the fire
The way that she could
I spend all my days
In the search for dry wood
Board all the windows and close the front door
I can't believe she won't be here anymore

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A season for joy
A season for sorrow
Where she's gone
I will surely, surely follow
She brightened my day
She warmed the coldest night
The Hounds of Winter
They got me in their sights

Sister moon will be my guide
In your blue blue shadows I would hide
All good people asleep tonight
I'm all by myself in your silver light
I would gaze at your face the whole night through

[Chorus]
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
I'd go out of my mind, but for you

[Verse 2]
Lying in a mother's arms
The primal root of a woman's charms
I'm a stranger to the sun
My eyes are too weak
How cold is a heart
When it's warmth that he seeks?
You watch every night, you don't care what I do

[Chorus]
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
I'd go out of my mind, but for you

My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
My hunger for her explains everything I've done
To howl at the moon the whole night through
And they really don't care if I do

Sting,"[Verse 1]
When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?
So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline
To face up to the truth of his soul
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge
Something strange, unexpected, out of control
There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection
And face what he sees without fear
It takes a man to accept his mortality
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear
It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself
And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else

[Chorus]
Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts
You still love her but she loves someone else
[Verse 2]
And where does that leave you?
You self-styled man of vision
You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?
To destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission?
Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind?
To regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man
Use the ice around your heart before it melts
But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself

[Chorus]
Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts
And still you still love her but she loves someone else1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite152EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Taylor-swift,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(""Meet me behind the mall"")
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1: Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type (You my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Future, & Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

You need to calm down, you're being too loud

You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn

But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and

And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace

And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same

Crossing out the good years

Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons

Tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves

Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time63EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long74EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?

Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down

Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right

Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me

Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (Would you run away?)

You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh

And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home

Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew

I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

Staring out an open window
Catching my death

Sending signals

Is there a line that I could just go cross?

I was dancing when the music stopped

Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

And you know you hurt him too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head

All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet

Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other

All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)

Taylor-swift,"[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn, I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Chorus 1]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it

Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
[Bridge]
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Chorus 2]
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

Shining just for you

And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

Taylor-swift,"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht

I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me

Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows

Magnificently cursed

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

No, no
I think he did it
No, no

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush

Everybody wants you

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery

I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone

Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone

Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""

Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between

Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me

Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time

I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh
[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone
[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong

And all these fairytales are full of it

Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time

Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

But in time you gon' find you was meant for me

I'm addicted, one hit won't do I need a lot of you
Overdosing, your potion has got me floating on cloud nine
Tell me what I'm supposed to do when I run out of you, I'm through

Maroon-5,"[Verse 1]
It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2]
A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to

But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then, the fact remains

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

Bathed in sunlight
By the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car

Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through

And we're only several miles from the Sun""

The perfection of her creation

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself150EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is27EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith & Justin Bieber]
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go!)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land (I'm gone)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden Smith]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say it, never-never say it)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'till forever make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up

Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better

Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down

Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be

More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh

Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months
And that's too much

Love the way you love your mom
Take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh

And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""

We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home

I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

[Verse 2]
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)
[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (Oh no, no no, no)

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (Oh)
I need you, don't let me go (No)
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de-, I don't de-, I don't deserve you tonight

[Bridge]
Somewhere in the sky (Yeah)
The way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me
I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na), uh
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah)
As you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong, oh-oh, ohh

[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (I can't live without you)
I need you, don't let me go (Hey)
Need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de- (I don't), I don't de- (I don't)
I don't deserve you tonight (You)
[Outro]
(I don't deserve you)
No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you)
Gotta need you
I can't breathe without you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Justin-bieber,"[Verse 1]
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn
[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

[Chorus]
They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad26EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
