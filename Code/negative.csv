  so close no matter how far

  forever trusting who we are  
  and nothing else matters

  and nothing else matters

  everyday for us something new  
  open mind for a different view

Metallica,"i can't remember anything  
  can't tell if this is true or a dream  
  deep down inside i feel to scream  
  this terrible silence stops me  
  now that the war is through with me  
  i'm waking up i cannot see  
  that there's not much left of me  
  nothing is real but pain now  
    
    
  hold my breath as i wish for death  
  oh please god wake me  
    
    
  back in the womb it's much too real  
  in pumps life that i must feel  
  but can't look forward to reveal  
  look to the time when i'll live  
  fed through the tube that sticks in me  
  just like a wartime novelty  
  tied to machines that make me be  
  cut this life off from me  
    
  hold my breath as i wish for death  
  oh please god wake me  
    
  short break  
    
    
  now the world is gone i'm just one  
  oh god help me  
  hold my breath as i wish for death  
  oh please god help me  
   break  
    
    
  darkness imprisoning me  
  all that i see absolute horror  
  i cannot live i cannot die  
  trapped in myself body my holding cell  
  landmine has taken my sight  
  taken my speech taken my hearing  
  taken my arms taken my legs  
  taken my soul left me with life in hell

Metallica,"new blood joins this earth and quickly he's subdued

Metallica,"make his fight on the hill in the early day  
  constant chill deep inside  
  shouting gun on they run through the endless grey  
  on they fight for their right yes but who's to say  
  for a hill men would kill why they do not know  
  stiffened wounds test their pride  
  men of five still alive through the raging glow  
  gone insane from the pain that they surely know  
    
    
  for whom the bell tolls  
  time marches on  
  for whom the bell tolls  
    
    
  take a look to the sky just before you die  
  it's the last time you will  
  blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky  
  shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry  
  stranger now are his eyes to this mystery  
  hears the silence so loud  
  crack of dawn all is gone except the will to be  
  now they see what will be blinded eyes to see  
    
  for whom the bell tolls  
  time marches on  
  for whom the bell tolls

  moon is full never seems to change

  no locked doors no windows barred  
  no things to make my brain seem scarred

  and i see fire hollowing souls  
  i see fire blood in the breeze  
  and i hope that you remember me  
    
  oh should my people fall then surely i'll do the same

  her thoughts are racing  
  set on overdrive  
    
  it takes a village  
  this she knows is true  
  they're expecting her  
  and she's got work to do

  it's meaningless to try  
  as he rubs his redrimmed eyes  
  he says i've never seen her get this bad  
    
  even though she seems so high  
  he knows that she can't fly  
  and when she falls out of the sky  
  he'll be standing by  
  she was raised in a small midwestern town  
  by a charming and eccentric loving father  
  she was praised as the perfect teenage girl  
  and everyone thought highly of her  
    
  and she tried everyday  
  with endless drive  
  to make the grade  
    
  then one day  
  she woke up to find  
  the perfect girl  
  had lost her mind  
    
  once barely taking a break  
  now she sleeps the days away  
    
  she helplessly stands by  
  it's meaningless to try  
  all she wants to do is cry  
  no one ever knew she was so sad  
    
  cause even though she gets so high  
  and thinks that she can fly  
  she will fall out of the sky  
  but in the face of misery  
  she found hopefulness  
  feeling better  
  she had weathered  
  this depression  
    
  much to her advantage  
  she resumed her frantic pace

  hearing voices from miles away  
  saying things never said

  of palmtrees and shrapnel  
  trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

  standing in the darkness  
  waiting for the light  
  the smell of pure adrenaline  
  burning in the night  
    
  random blinding flashes  
  aiming at the stage  
   tape begins to roll  
  igniting sonic rage  
    
  still they keep me between these hollow walls  
  hoping to find in me  
  the answers to the test that stumped them all  
  the boy is simply crazy  
  suffering from delusions  
  we honestly think that maybe  
  he might need an institution  
  he lives in a world of fiction  
  and really could use some help  
  we have just the place to fix him  
  to save him from himself  
    
  curled up in the darkness  
  searching for the light  
  the smell of stale sweat and shit  
  streaming through the night  
    
  random urine testing  
  pills red pink and blue  
  counseling and therapy  
  providing not a clue  
    
  still they keep me between these hollow walls  
  hoping to find in me  
  the answers to the test that stumped them all  
    
  we can't seem to find the answers  
  he seemed such a clear cut case  
  we cannot just let him leave here  
  and put all this work to waste  
  why don't we try shock treatment  
  it really might do some help  
  we have just the tools to fix him  
  to save him from himself

  vi solitary shell  
  lyrics john petrucci  
    
    
  he seemed no different from the rest  
  just a healthy normal boy  
  his mama always did her best  
  and he was daddy's pride and joy  
    
  he learned to walk and talk on time  
  but never cared much to be held  
  and steadily he would decline  
  into his solitary shell  
    
  as a boy he was considered somewhat odd  
  kept to himself most of the time  
  he would daydream in and out of his own world  
  but in every other way he was fine  
    
  he's a monday morning lunatic  
  disturbed from time to time  
  lost within himself  
  in his solitary shell  
    
  a temporary catatonic  
  madman on occasion  
  when will he break out  
  of his solitary shell  
    
  he struggled to get through his day  
  he was helplessly behind  
  he poured himself onto the page  
  writing for hours at a time  
    
  as a man he was a danger to himself  
  fearful and sad most of the time  
  he was drifting in and out of sanity  
  but in every other way he was fine  
    
  he's a monday morning lunatic  
  disturbed from time to time  
  lost within himself  
  in his solitary shell  
    
  a momentary maniac  
  with casual delusions  
  when will he be let out  
  of his solitary shell

  the darkness far behind me

  despair will never find me  
    
  i feel strong  
  i've got a new sense of elation  
  boundless energy  
  euphoria fixation  
    
  still it's hard to just get by  
  it seems so meaningless to try  
  when all i want to do is cry  
  who would ever know i felt so sad  
    
  even though i get so high  
  i know that i will never fly  
  and when i fall out of the sky

  lyrics john petrucci  
    
    
  she dresses in black everyday  
  she keeps her hair simple and plain  
  she never wears makeup  
  but no one would care if she did anyway  
    
  she doesn't recall yesterday  
  faces seem twisted and strange  
  but she always wakes up  
  only to find she'd been miles away  
    
  absence of awareness  
  losing time  
  a lapse of perception  
  losing time  
    
  wanting to escape  
  she had created a way to survive  
  she learned to detach from herself  
  a behavior that kept her alive  
    
  hope in the face of our human distress  
  helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside  
  that takes hold of our lives  
    
  shame and disgrace over mental unrest  
  keeps us from saving those we love  
  the grace within our hearts  
  and the sorrow in our souls  
    
  deception of fame  
  vengeance of war  
  lives torn apart  
    
  losing oneself  
  spiraling down  
  feeling the walls closing in

  the answers inside

  and i turned it down because i was busy and  
  i guess too much of a chickenshit to do it  
  and i feel sorry for that because it was a very very close friend of mine  
    
  so i wanted to apologize to anyone  
  that i've upset or offended by my words  
  it's just an opinion but unfortunately  
  i tend to express it as a fact  
  and that's kind of arrogant isn't it  
  i think it's the betrayal  
  it still haunts me  
  i'm sorry for what i did back then  
  i was a different person  
  i really was and i'm so sorry  
  i wish it wouldn't have happened but it did  
  and i'm sorry will you forgive me  
    
  i guess i'm simply sorry for being me and not you  
  i so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way

  if we are painstaking about this phase of our development  
  we will be amazed before we are halfway through  
  we are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness  
  we will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it  
    
  we will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace  
  no matter how far down the scale we have gone  
  we will see how our experience can benefit others  
  that feeling of uselessness and selfpity will disappear  
    
  we will lose interest in selfish things  
  and gain interest in our fellows  
  selfseeking will slip away  
  our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change  
    
  fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us  
  we will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us  
  we will suddenly realize that god is doing for us  
  what we could not do for ourselves  
    
  are these extravagant promises we think not  
  they have been fulfilled amongst others  
  sometimes quickly sometimes slowly  
  we will always be true to our principles  
    
  you're only as sick as your secrets  
  but the truth shall set you free  
    
  the truth is the truth  
  and so all you can do is live with itembedshare urlcopyembedcopy",0

  acting without thought of consequence  
  spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
  while spitting on the ones that matter most

  fighting for the credit they once stole

  there's a chapter on love where the ink's never dry  
  there are sentences served in a prison i built out of lies  
    
    
  though the pages are numbered  
  i can't see where they lead  
  for the end is a mystery noone can read  
  in the book of my life  
    
  there's a chapter on fathers a chapter on sons  
  there are pages of conflicts that nobody won  
  and the battles you lost and your bitter defeat  
  there's a page where we fail to meet  
    
  there are tales of good fortune that couldn't be planned  
  there's a chapter on god that i don't understand  
  there's a promise of heaven and hell but i'm damned if i see

  now the daylight's returning  
  and if one sentence is true  
  all these pages are burning

  there's a bloodless moon where the ocean died  
  a shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets  
  and the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie  
  where is the fisherman where is the goat  
  where is the keeper in his carrion coat  
  eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies  
  where is the child with his father's eyes  
    
  there are the soul cages x  
    
  he's the king of the ninth world  
  the twisted son of the fog bells toll  
  in each and every lobster cage  
  a tortured human soul  
    
  these are the souls of broken factories  
  the subject slaves of the broken crown  
  the dead accounting of old guilty promises  
  these are the souls of the broken town  
    
    
  these are the soul cagesx  
    
    
  'i have a wager' the brave child spoke  
  the fisherman laughed though disturbed at the joke  
  'you will drink what i drink but you must equal me  
  and if the drink leaves me standing a soul shall go free'  
  'i have here a cask of most magical wine  
  a vintage that blessed every ship in the line  
  it's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died  
  young white bodies adrift in the tide'  
  'and what's in it for me my pretty young thing  
  why should i whistle when the caged bird sings  
  if you lose a wager with the king of the sea  
  you'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me  
  a body lies open in the fisherman's yard  
  like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips  
  one less soul in the soul cages  
  one last curse on the fisherman's lips

  don't be afraid to stand alone  
  don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone  
  i know it's hard away from home  
  and it ain't easy all alone  
  relationships over the phone  
  talkin' to your significant other all night long

  had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
  now you're standin' right in front of me  
  it hurts me to know that i lied  
  try to protect your feelings  
  you read in between the lines  
  hope your heart has started healing oh
