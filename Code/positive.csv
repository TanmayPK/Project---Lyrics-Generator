Metallica,"life it seems will fade away  
  drifting further every day  
  getting lost within myself  
  nothing matters no one else  
  i have lost the will to live  
  simply nothing more to give  
  there is nothing more for me  
  need the end to set me free  
    
    
  things not what they used to be  
  missing one inside of me  
  deathly lost this can't be real  
  cannot stand this hell i feel  
  emptiness is filling me  
  to the point of agony  
  growing darkness taking dawn  
  i was me but now he's gone  
    
    
  no one but me can save myself but it's too late  
  now i can't think think why i should even try  
  yesterday seems as though it never existed  
  death greets me warm now i will just say goodbye  
  goodbye

Metallica,"on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha  
  you can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song  
  you can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before  
  but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do  
  when you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do  
  you don't feel much like riding you just wish the trip was through  
    
    
  but here i am on the road again  
  there i am up on the stage  
  there i go playing the star again  
  there i go turn the page  
    
  so you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road  
  and you feel the eyes upon you as you're shaking off the cold  
  you pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode  
  and most times you can't hear them talk other times you can  
  all the same old cliches is it woman is it man  
  and you always seem outnumbered you don't dare make a stand make your stand  
    
    
  but here i am on the road again  
  there i am up on the stage  
  here i go playing the star again  
  there i go turn the page  
    
  out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away  
  every ounce of energy you try to give away  
  and the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play  
  later in the evening as you lie awake in bed  
  with the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head  
  you smoke the day's last cigarette remembering what she said  
  what she said  
    
    
  but here i am on the road again  
  there i am up on the stage  
  here i go playing the star again  
  there i go turn the page

  sweet love all night long  
    
    
  they say true love's the greatest weapon  
  to win the war caused by pain pain  
  but every diamond has imperfections  
  but my love's too pure to watch it chip away  
  boy nothing real can be threatened  
  true love breathes salvation back into me  
  with every tear came redemption  
  and my torturer became my remedy

  kiss up and rub up and feel up

  we teach girls to shrink themselves to make themselves smaller  
  we say to girls you can have ambition but not too much  
  you should aim to be successful but not too successful  
  otherwise you will threaten the man  
  because i am female i am expected to aspire to marriage  
  i am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important ccandy on the ground  
  now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support dumdahdeda  
  but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same dodada dodo dodododa  
  we raise girls to see each other as competitors  
  not for jobs or for accomplishments which i think can be a good thing comcomcomin' down drippin' candy on the ground  
  but for the attention of men  
  we teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are dumdahdeda

  and when my voice is screaming out to my own ears  
  that feels different from when i hear yours

  what i'm viewing is a little different

  theres nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on  
  you got to trust me ma  
    
    
  i can't believe i believed everything we had would last  
  so young and naive of me to think she was from your past  
  silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids  
  love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong  
    
    
  i can't believe i fell for your schemes i'm smarter than that  
  so dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man  
  foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women  
  it took me some time but now i moved on  
  because i realized i've got  
    
    
  me myself and i  
  that's all i got in the end  
  that's what i found out  
  and it ain't no need to cry  
  i took a vow that from now on i'm gon' be my own best friend  
  me myself and i  
  that's all i got in the end  
  that's what i found out  
  and it ain't no need to cry  
  i took a vow that from now on i'm gon' be my own best friend  
    
  you're so controlling you say that you love me but you don't  
  your family told me one day i would see it on my own  
  next thing i know i'm dealing with your three kids in my home  
  love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong  
    
    
  now that it's over stop callin' me  
  come pick up your clothes  
  ain't no need to front like you're still with me  
  all your homies know  
  even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low  
  it took me some time but now i am strong  
  because i realized i've got

  inside the necklace you got when you were  
  next to your heartbeat where i should be  
  keep it deep within your soul  
  and if you hurt me well that's okay baby  
  only words bleed inside these pages  
  you just hold me  
  and i won't ever let you go  
    
    
  when i'm away i will remember how you kissed me

Ed-sheeran,"i met this girl late last year  
  she said don't you worry if i disappear  
  i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake  
  i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
  but then i jumped right in a week later returned  
  i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
  but i gave her my time for two or three nights  
  then i put it on pause until the moment was right  
  i went away for months until our paths crossed again  
  she told me i was never looking for a friend  
  maybe you could swing by my room around ten  
  baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin  
  we'll be in between the sheets till the late am  
  baby if you wanted me then you should have just said she's singing  
    
  don't hhh with my love  
  that heart is so cold  
  all over my home  
  i don't wanna know that babe  
  don't hhh with my love  
  i told her she knows  
  take aim and reload  
  i don't wanna know that babe  
    
  and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her  
  we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza  
  before a text message was the only way to reach her  
  now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her  
  singing out aretha all over the track like a feature  
  and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either  
  but me and her we make money the same way  
  four cities two planes the same day  
  and those shows have never been what it's about  
  but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
  i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch  
  but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now  
  wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out  
  when she was kissing him how i was confused about  
  now she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing  
    
  don't hhh with my love  
  that heart is so cold  
  all over my home  
  i don't wanna know that babe  
  don't hhh with my love

  take aim and reload  
  i don't wanna know that babe  
    
  knock knock knock on my hotel door  
  i don't even know if she knows what for  
  she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya  
  trust and respect is what we do this for  
  i never intended to be next get lost  
  but you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
  and i never saw him as a threat get lost  
  until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
  it's not like we were both on tour  
  we were staying on the same hhh hotel floor  
  and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
  but it was never just fun and i thought you were different  
  this is not the way you realized what you wanted  
  it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest  
  and all this time god knows i'm singing

Ed-sheeran,"i was born inside a small town i lost that state of mind  
  learned to sing inside the lord's house but stopped the age of nine  
  i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride  
  the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind  
  so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life  
  friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride  
  and when the world's against me is when i really come alive  
  and every day that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride  
  you know that i've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs  
  i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun  
  i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up  
  instead i look in the mirror questioning what i've become  
  guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me  
  without a ninetofive job or a uni degree

  i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong  
  i think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell  
  relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well  
  and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps  
  because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun  
  please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run  
  i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become  
  conversations with my father on the a  
  age telling me i've gotta chase those dreams  
  now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me  
  with my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans  
  wembley stadium crowd's thou'  
  i may have grown up but i hope that damian's proud

  and i wont be a product of my genre  
  my mind will always be stronger than my songs are  
  never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya  
  always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia  
  musically im demonstrating

  all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it  
  not to abuse it and get affected infected with the who's who of music  
  who did it who is it who's in it or what the hell does it matter  
  chitter chatter don't matter what a yidder yidder yadder it don't matter to me  
  all i want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely  
  to be me in this seedy needy world can you hear me  
  hey so i keep singing that  
  when i first started this rapping shit i felt pressure from haters  
  became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar  
  and made for the stars kept my grind in the dark  
  and then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody  
  hennesey shots and glocks all these fools on the block  
  who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top  
  i'm just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy  
  with my head in the sky ed sheeran urban angel coming ready to die  
  so see the signs stand to the side  
  open your eyes and take a look and realize  
  the resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears  
  i arise from my tomb in disguise all alone alonestar  
  urban angel rising from the ashes  
  surprising all haters guiding now moving steady

  a big fat bag of high grade weed you know i got to have it

  i won't stop until my name's in lights  
  with stadium heights with damian rice  
  on red carpets now i'm on arabian nights  
  because i'm young i know my brothers gonna give me advice  
  long nighter short height and i gone hyper  
  never be anything but a singersongwriter yeah  
  the game's over but now i'm on a new level  
  watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal  
  people think that i'm bound to blow up  
  i've done around about a thousand shows but  
  i haven't got a house plus i live on a couch  
  so you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out  
  wow from day one i've been prepared  
  with v wax for my ginger hair  
  now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of  
  what the future holds cause it's another day  
    
    
  rucksack with the old clothes i rap with cold flows  
  i'm back with the old jokes in fact you don't know  
  on tracks i throw blows to make my punchlines relevant  
  if you can't keep up you'll get none you're celibate  
  my flows developing skin lacks the melanin  
  give me a shot of adrenaline and i get it in  
  do it for the hell of it  
  cause ever since i hit the mainstream with the a team i seem to sell a bit  
  i took what held me back with the women then i packaged the image  
  put in some content then i sold it back as a gimmick  
  the fact is this i'll end up dating actresses  
  wake up on dirty mattresses i think i'll need to practice this  
  but i make shit happen call me a laxative  
  world's on my shoulders i don't even know what atlas is  
  hard bars sharp like a cactus is  
  i'm back to rapping back to back cause i've been practicing  
  i'm back to sing this  
    
    
  cause you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you at all  
  you need me man i don't need you  
  you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you at all  
  you need me man  
    
    
  i'll keep my last name forever keep this genre pretty basic  
  and i'll be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it  
  and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift  
  into another rapper shoes using new laces  
  i'm selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the papers  
  selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the majors  
  nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back  
  clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache  
  i hit back when the pen hurts me  
  i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee  
  i'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though  
  according to the myspace and youtube videos  
  i'm always doing shows if i'm not i'm in the studio  
  truly broke never growing up call me rufio  
  melody music maker reading all the papers  
  they say i'm up and coming like i'm fucking in an elevator  
    
    
  cause you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i dont need you at all  
  you need me man i don't need you  
  you need me man i dont need you

  oh honestly  
  offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon  
  gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm  
  they gave me the heartache and in return i gave a song

  playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd

  i can't no i won't hush  
  i'll say the words that make you blush

  see im true my songs are where my heart is  
  i'm like glue i stick to other artists  
  i'm not you now that would be disastrous  
  let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures  
  see i'm real i do it all it's all me

  name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing  
  i sing fast i know that all my shit's cool  
  i will blast and i didn't go to brit school  
  i came fast with the way i act right  
  i can't last if i'm smoking on a crack pipe  
  and i won't be a product of my genre  
  my mind will always be stronger than my songs are  
  never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya  
  always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia  
  and musically i'm demonstrating  
  when i perform live feels like i am meditating  
  times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me  
  a young singerwriter like a gabriella cilmi  
    
    
  'cause you need me man i dont need you  
  you need me man i don't need you

  long nighter short height and i gone hyper  
  never be anything but a singersongwriter yeah  
  the game's over but now i'm on a new level  
  watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal  
  people think that i'm bound to blow up  
  i've done around about a thousand shows but  
  i haven't got a house plus i live on a couch  
  so you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out  
  wow from day one i've been prepared  
  with v wax for my ginger hair  
  so now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of  
  what the future holds 'cause it's another day  
  plus i'll keep my last name forever keep this genre pretty basic  
  gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it  
  and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift  
  slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces  
  i'm selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers  
  selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors  
  nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back  
  clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache  
  i hit back when the pen hurts me  
  i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee

  this love is ablaze i saw flames from the side of the stage  
  and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days  
  until then we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know  
  but somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke  
  let it go until our roads are changed  
  singin' we found love in a local rave  
  no i don't really know what i'm supposed to say  
  but i can just figure it out then hope and pray  
  i told her my name then said it's nice to meet you  
  then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila  
  i already know if she's a keeper  
  just from this one small act of kindness i'm in  
  deep shit if anybody finds out  
  i meant to drive home but i drunk all of it now  
  not soberin' up we just sit on the couch  
  one thing led to another now she's kissin' my mouth  
  pre  
  i need you darling  
  come on set the tone  
  if you feel you're fallin'  
  wont you let me know

  but can you feel it

  before the beat kicks in again  
  can you feel it  
  can you feel it

  they're more like tsunami tides in my eyes  
  never getting dry so i get high  
  smoke away the days never sleep with the light on  
  weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
  and i'm still drunk at the end of the night  
  i don't drink like everybody else

  everythings great not everythings sure  
  but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus  
  now i'm in position to be another stalker  
  like every thing i say seems to always sound awkward  
  like our last kiss it was perfect we were nervous  
  on the surface  
  and i'm always saying everyday that it was worth it  
  pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
  i forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
  and go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

  and maybe i can let myself down wooahh

  keep looking around to make sure i'm not the only one to feel low  
  because if you want i'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered

Ed-sheeran,"i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow  
  i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know  
  you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in  
  i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden  
  watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision  
  signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism  
  thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen  
  studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven  
  and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager  
  i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather  
  i'll do my own thing now and get respect after  
  and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter  
  for four years i never had a place to stay  
  but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight  
  at years old yeah i moved out of my home  
  i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked  
  and went from sleeping at a subway station  
  to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population  
  not my imagination i don't wanna relax  
  would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now

  mmm come on and take it back love  
  come on and take it back for us  
  don't you fade into the back love  
  no  
    
  i take it back with the rhythm and blues  
  with my rap pack i'll be singing the news  
  tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school  
  i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop  
  bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes  
  i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth  
  and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit  
  they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot  
  but then again that's what they're supposed to do  
  and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm  
  whispering everything that happens is from now on  
  i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song  
  and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong  
  but then i've never had an enemy except the nme  
  but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be  
  with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees  
  are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree  
  singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids  
  i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic  
  i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it  
  this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  
    
  hook  
  mmm come on and take it back love  
  come on and take it back for us  
  don't you fade into the back love  
  no i'll take it back now  
    
  now i don't ever wanna be perfect  
  'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless  
  and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed  
  taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus  
  putting on a brave face like timothy dalton  
  considering a name change thinking it was hopeless  
  rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition  
  'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written  
  now absence can make your heart ache  
  but drinking absinthe can change your mind state  
  vividly need to let my liver be  
  and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends  
  it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me  
  and i hope to see him blowing up globally  
  'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally  
  it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but  
  but i just write schemes  
  i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans  
  madison square garden is where i might be but more likely  
  you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates  
  having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made  
  and every single second knowing that we'll never betray  
  the way we were raised remembering our background sat down  
  that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  
  hook  
  mmm come on and take it back love  
  come on and take it back for us  
  don't you fade into the back love  
  no  
  mmm come on and take it back love  
  come on and take it back for us  
  don't you fade into the back love  
  no  
    
    
  my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme  
  till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie  
  with this you must know that the numbers just sold  
  will keep me going through the tough times dream with me  
  we forget percent of it when we wake  
  but the other percent it never fades  
  dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads  
  tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade  
  oh never give up just remember just to hold out more  
  a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought  
  you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors  
  now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour  
  writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit  
  you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick  
  i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss  
  and most of these other guys are kids that pose  
  his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is  
  dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it  
  tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower  
  you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

  sometimes i wonder in any other summer  
  could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder  
  under the covers where we used to lay  
  and re stacks is what the speakers played  
  i'd be on tour almost every day  
  when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
  just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed  
  getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe  
  we used each other's air just for the people to see  
  and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
  we go anywhere our minds would take us  
  and i'll say you are beautiful without your makeup  
  and you dont even need to worry about your weight cause  
  we can all be loved the way that god made us  
  and time's the only reason that we could break up  
  cause you would always tell me i'm away too much  
  distance is relative to the time that it takes  
  to get on a plane or make a mistake so say it again  
    
    
  oh nina  
  you should go nina  
  cause i ain't never coming home nina  
  oh won't you leave me now  
  and i've been living on the road nina  
  but then again you should know nina  
  cause thats you and me both nina  
  oh won't you leave me now now  
    
  and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie  
  with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold  
  taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own  
  cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone  
  watching blue planet creating new habits  
  acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish  
  back to the burrow with all the celtics  
  i disappear you call me selfish  
  i understand but i cant help it  
  i put my job over everything except my family and friends  
  but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back  
  overlook the situation  
  cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
  and i'm not saying we should be taking a break  
  just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake and its too late  
  so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane  
  but in a day we'll have to say it again  
    
    
  oh nina  
  you should go nina  
  cause i ain't never coming home nina  
  oh won't you leave me now  
  and i've been living on the road nina

  cause thats you and me both nina  
  oh won't you leave me now now

  but you can't make it on your own  
  sing that song go

Ed-sheeran,"i should ink my skin with your name  
  and take my passport out again  
  and just replace it  
  see i could do without a tan  
  on my left hand  
  where my fourth finger meets my knuckle  
  and i should run you a hot bath  
  fill it up with bubbles  
  'cause maybe you're loveable  
  maybe you're my snowflake  
  and your eyes turn from green to gray  
  and in the winter i'll hold you in a cold place  
  and you should never cut your hair  
  'cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder  
    
  hook  
  and you will never know  
  just how beautiful you are to me  
  but maybe i'm just in love  
  when you wake me up  
    
    
  and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me  
  could you make me a cup of tea  
  to open my eyes in the right way  
  and i know you love shrek  
  'cause we've watched it times  
  and maybe you're hoping for a fairytale too  
  and if your dvd breaks today  
  you should've got a vcr  
  because i've never owned a bluray true say  
  i know i've always been shit at computer games  
  and your brother always beats me  
  and if i lost i go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv  
  and then you laugh at me  
  and be asking me  
  if i'm gonna be home next week  
  and then you lie with me 'til i fall asleep  
  and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  
  hook  
  and you will never know  
  just how beautiful you are to me  
  but maybe i'm just in love  
  when you wake me up  
    
    
  and i think you hate the smell of smoke  
  you always try and get me to stop  
  but you drink as much as me  
  and i get drunk a lot  
  so ill take you to the beach  
  and walk along the sand  
  and i'll make you a heart pendant  
  with a pebble held in my hand  
  and i'll carve it like a necklace  
  so the heart falls where your chest is  
  now a piece of me is a piece of the beach  
  and it falls just where it needs to be  
  and rests peacefully  
  so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now  
  against yours now  
  cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  
  or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up  
  maybe i fell in love when you woke me upembedshare urlcopyembedcopy",1
Ed-sheeran,"it's just another night and i'm staring at the moon  
  i saw a shooting star and thought of you  
  i sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  
  if you were here i'd sing to you  
  you're on the other side as the skyline splits in two  
  i'm miles away from seeing you  
  but i can see the stars from america  
  i wondered do you see them too  
    
    
  so open your eyes and see  
  the way our horizons meet  
  and all of the lights will lead  
  into the night with me  
  and i know these scars will bleed  
  but both of our hearts believe  
  all of these stars will guide us home  
    
    
  i can hear your heart on the radio beat  
  they're playing chasing cars and i thought of us  
  back to the time you were lying next to me  
  i looked across and fell in love  
  so i took your hand back through lamp lit streets i knew  
  everything led back to you  
  so can you see the stars over amsterdam  
  you're the song my heart is beating to  
    
  so open your eyes and see  
  the way our horizons meet  
  and all of the lights will lead  
  into the night with me

Stevie-wonder,"no new year's day to celebrate  
  no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away  
  no first of spring no song to sing  
  in fact here's just another ordinary day  
  no april rain no flowers bloom  
  no wedding saturday within the month of june  
  but what it is is something true  
  made up of these three words that i must say to you  
    
    
  i just called to say i love you  
  i just called to say how much i care  
  i just called to say i love you  
  and i mean it from the bottom of my heart  
    
    
  no summer's high  
  no warm july  
  no harvest moon to light one tender august night  
  no autumn breeze  
  no falling leaves  
  not even time for birds to fly to southern skies  
  no libra sun  
  no halloween  
  no giving thanks to all the christmas joy you bring  
  but what it is though old so new  
  to fill your heart like no three words could ever do

  then my only worry was for christmas what would be my toy  
  even though we sometimes would not get a thing  
  we were happy with the joy the day would bring  
  sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine  
  greeted at the back door with boy thought i told you not to go outside  
  tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes  
  thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind  
    
    
  i wish those days could come back once more  
  why did those days ever have to go

  just don't tell and i'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world  
  mama gives you money for sunday school  
  you trade yours for candy after church is through  
  smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall you nasty boy  
  teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall

  the hounds of winter  
  they follow me down  
    
  i can't make up the fire  
  the way that she could

  in the search for dry wood  
  board all the windows and close the front door

  a season for sorrow

Sting,"when a man of my age shaves his face in the morning  
  who is it that stares back and greets him  
  the ghost of his father long dead all these years  
  or the boy that he was still wet in the ears  
  or the terrible sum of all of his fears  
  in the eyes of this stranger who meets him  
  so his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline  
  to face up to the truth of his soul  
  it's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge  
  something strange unexpected out of control  
  there are times when a man needs to brave his reflection  
  and face what he sees without fear  
  it takes a man to accept his mortality  
  or be surprised by the presence of a tear  
  it was only an arrangement a practical arrangement  
  i forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook  
  don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself  
  and fall in love with someone when she loves someone else  
    
    
  like a covering of snow on a winter's night  
  it glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight  
  but it's gone by the morning how quickly it melts  
  you still love her but she loves someone else  
    
  and where does that leave you  
  you selfstyled man of vision  
  you feel stupid you feel angry are you losing your mind  
  to destroy the one she loves does that become your mission  
  like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind  
  to regain your selfrespect hold your head up like a man  
  use the ice around your heart before it melts  
  but you're not fooling anybody you're only fooling yourself  
    
    
  like a covering of snow on a winter's night  
  it glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight  
  but it's gone by the morning how quickly it melts

  keychain on the ground we were always skippin' town  
  and i was thinkin' on the drive down any time now  
  he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was  
  'til we were dead and gone and buried  
  check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same  
  after three months in the grave

  there was nothing else i could do

  some actress askin' me what happened you  
  that's what happened you

  and i've been meaning to tell you  
  i think your house is haunted  
  your dad is always mad and that must be why  
  and i think you should come live with me  
  and we can be pirates  
  then you won't have to cry  
  or hide in the closet  
  and just like a folk song  
  our love will be passed on

  we're singing in the car getting lost upstate  
  autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

  photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red  
  you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed  
  and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the teeball team  
  you taught me 'bout your past thinking your future was me  
  and you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy  
  key chain on the ground we were always skipping town  
  and i was thinking on the drive down any time now  
  he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was  
  'til we were dead and gone and buried  
  check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same  
  after three months in the grave  
  and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you  
  but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame  
  pre  
  and i know it's long gone and  
  there was nothing else i could do  
  and i forget about you long enough  
  to forget why i needed to  
    
    
  'cause there we are again in the middle of the night  
  we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light  
  down the stairs i was there  
  i remember it all too well  
  and there we are again when nobody had to know  
  you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath  
  sacred prayer and we'd swear  
  to remember it all too well yeah  
    
    
  well maybe we got lost in translation  
  maybe i asked for too much  
  but maybe this thing was a masterpiece

  running scared i was there  
  i remember it all too well  
  and you call me up again just to break me like a promise  
  so casually cruel in the name of being honest  
  i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here  
  'cause i remember it all all all  
    
  they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell

  you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine

  that's what happened you  
  you who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes  
  sipping coffee like you're on a latenight show  
  but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come  
  and he said it's supposed to be fun turning twentyone  
    
    
  time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it  
  i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it  
  after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own  
  now you mail back my things and i walk home alone  
  but you keep my old scarf from that very first week  
  'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me  
  you can't get rid of it  
  'cause you remember it all too well yeah  
    
    
  'cause there we are again when i loved you so  
  back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known  
  it was rare i was there  
  i remember it all too well  
  wind in my hair you were there  
  you remember it all  
  down the stairs you were there  
  you remember it all  
  it was rare i was there  
  i remember it all too well  
    
  and i was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes  
  i'll get older but your lovers stay my age  
  from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones  
  i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight  
  and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue  
  just between us did the love affair maim you too  
  'cause in this city's barren cold  
  i still remember the first fall of snow  
  and how it glistened as it fell  
  i remember it all too well  
    
    
  just between us did the love affair maim you all too well  
  just between us do you remember it all too well  
  just between us i remember it just between us all too well  
  wind in my hair i was there i was there  
  down the stairs i was there i was there  
  sacred prayer i was there i was there  
  it was rare you remember it all too well  
  wind in my hair i was there i was there  
  down the stairs i was there i was there  
  sacred prayer i was there i was there  
  it was rare you remember it  
  wind in my hair i was there i was there  
  down the stairs i was there i was there  
  sacred prayer i was there i was there  
  it was rare you remember it  
  wind in my hair i was there i was there  
  down the stairs i was there i was there  
  sacred prayer i was there i was there
